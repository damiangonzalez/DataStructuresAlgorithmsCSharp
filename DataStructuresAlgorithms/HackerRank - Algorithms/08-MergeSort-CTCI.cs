    // The below is from CTCI page 147
    // Merge Sort I Runtime: 0 ( n log ( n)) average and worst case. Memory: Depends.
    // Merge sort divides the array in half, sorts each of those halves, and then merges them back together.
    // Each of those halves has the same sorting algorithm applied to it. Eventually, you are merging just two
    // singleÂ­ element arrays. It is the "merge" part that does all the heavy lifting.
    // The merge method operates by copying all the elements from the target array segment into a helper array,
    // keeping track of where the start of the left and right halves should be (helperleft and helperRight).
    // We then iterate through helper, copying the smaller element from each half into the array. At the end,
    // we copy any remaining elements into the target array.
    // You may notice that only the remaining elements from the left half of the helper array are copied into the
    // target array. Why not the right half? The right half doesn't need to be copied because it's already there.
    // Consider, for example, an array like [ 1, 4, 5 11 2, 8, 9] (the"11"indicates the partition point).
    // Prior to merging the two halves, both the helper array and the target array segment will end with [ 8, 9].
    // Once wecopyoverfourelements(1, 4, 5,and2)intothetargetarray,the[8, 9]willstillbeinplaceinboth arrays.
    // There's no need to copy them over.
    // The space complexity of merge sort is 0(n) due to the auxiliary space used to merge parts of the array.
